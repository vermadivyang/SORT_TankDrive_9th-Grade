#Science Olympiad Robot Tour Tank Drive -Using the FTC robot controller

This code is for Division C of SORT. This team is from Saint Joe Public School, MI. The Repo is forked from team 13702 which is a JoeBots team. I, the author of this repo, is a mentor for the Joebots. We used 13702's code due to issuses with getting the robot controllor FTC to push. After forking, we deleted most files and started from base code from the FTC controllor

## NOTICE

This repository contains the code SIMILAR to the public FTC SDK for the INTO THE DEEP (2024-2025) competition season.
